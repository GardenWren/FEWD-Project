# FEWD-Project
This is my Code Louisville Front End Web Development class final project.   I have chosen to create a portfolio website for my sister Emma who is an artist.

I have attempted to provide helpful comments to direct you to the function of various sections within code.

I have used media queries to cause different layouts for the navigation bar, Meet the Artist and Portfolio sections for different viewport sizes in hopes of giving a better user experience.

In order to allow my sister to update her portfolio without having to edit any code I have used Ajax and Jquery to import the information from the portfolio.json file from the img folder and dynamicly create many of the content portions of the website.  This file contains information on images to be shown and the related captions as well as the way they should be divided.   The content is not only updated dynamicly in the portfolio sections of the webpage but also within the navigation allowing her greater versitility in rearranging her portfolio without editing the code.

In order to view this web page please download the repository and run index.html

Thank you,
